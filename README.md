# Strong Interactions need Strong Machines

First time ever using the Reveal.js framework through Quarto for a presentation.
It is just a preliminary benchtest.

(Due to compatibility issues, which need to be further investigated, a few elements could appear misaligned ◡̈ )



A live demo of the presentation is available [here](https://roberto-dionisio.github.io/PhD_seminar_quarto/quarto_PhD_seminar.html#/title-slide)
